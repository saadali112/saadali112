# 👋 **HEY, I'M SAAD ALI**

 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate  final-year  cybersecurity student and developer with hands-on experience in **SOC operations**, **penetration testing**, and applying **AI/ML** to detect and mitigate threats. I build security tools, analyze network traffic, and automate defensive workflows. I enjoy working on open-source projects, collaborating in CTFs and hackathons, and contributing to the security community.
